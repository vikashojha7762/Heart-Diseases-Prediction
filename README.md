# Heart-Diseases-Prediction
 Heart Disease Prediction
This project predicts the presence of heart disease using patient clinical data and machine learning.
It includes a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating data analysis, feature exploration, and model building for heart disease classification.

📁 Project Structure
Heart_disease_prediction.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook for data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.

heart.csv → Dataset containing clinical attributes and heart disease diagnosis.

🚀 Features
Loaded and preprocessed clinical data relevant to heart disease.

Performed detailed exploratory data analysis using visualizations.

Developed a machine learning classification model to predict heart disease presence.

Evaluated model performance with relevant metrics.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)

Scikit-learn (machine learning modeling)

Jupyter Notebook (interactive analysis)

▶️ How to Run
1️⃣ Clone Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction

📊 Usage
The notebook loads the heart disease dataset (heart.csv) and explores key features such as age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, and others.

Running the notebook cells performs data visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

Target variable target indicates heart disease presence (1) or absence (0).

📈 Results
Insights from exploratory data analysis highlight important risk factors.

The classification model achieves good prediction accuracy for heart disease presence.
